# Hi there 👋
My name is Alex and I am in my fifth year at ETSU for Computer Science with a focus in Information Technology. I started as a Music Education major but I quickly found out that teaching just wasn't for me. I've always been fascinated with computers so I thought to myself, "Maybe I should try majoring in it." I have enjoyed every moment of my time in the Computer Science major at ETSU and can't wait to see what all is to come!
